                      <h2>BLACKPINK</h2>
                      <p>BLACKPINK is a South Korean Girl Group formed by YG Entertainment, the members auditioned with the entertainment agency to become students or 'trainees' with the hope of one day making their debut as a recording artist. When Blackpink debuted, their label YG Entertainment said the name intends to convey that the group embodies more than beauty. The group was formed in August 2016 consisting members of JISOO, JENNIE, ROSÉ, and LISA. Jennie was the first to be signed on as a trainee (she was only 14) and the first to be confirmed as a member of the girl group. Then, Thai rapper Lisa became the second trainee at YG Entertainment in 2011. In that same year, Jisoo became a trainee before landing a spot in the band, then Rosé became the fourth and final member, signing on as a trainee in 2012.
The meaning of BLACKPINK aims to contradict the common perception of the color pink. Pink is commonly used to portray prettiness, but BLACKPINK actually means to say that 'Pretty isn’t everything.' It also symbolizes that they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent.</p>

                      <h2>RED VELVET</h2>
                      <p>Red Velvet (Korean: 레드벨벳; RR: Redeu Belbet) is a South Korean girl group formed and managed by SM Entertainment. They originally debuted on August 1, 2014, with the single "Happiness" with the four-member line-up of Irene, Seulgi, Wendy, and Joy. A fifth member, Yeri, joined in March 2015, following the release of their first extended play, the chart-topping Ice Cream Cake. Sonically, the music of Red Velvet reflects their group name: their predominantly-pop "red" side experiments occasionally with electronic and funk, while their "velvet" side focuses on '90s-influenced R&B with elements of ballad and hip hop.</p>
